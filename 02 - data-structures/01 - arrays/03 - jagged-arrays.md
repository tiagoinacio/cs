# Jagged arrays

Sometimes, we do not want to have a rectangular multidimensional array. Because we may want arrays width different sizes. If we have a multi dimensional array representing the days in each month, we would end up with arrays with 31, 30, 27 and elements.

Jagged arrays are arrays of arrays with different lengths. We often need programming logic to create this type of data structure.
