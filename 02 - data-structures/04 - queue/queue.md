# Queue

Just like the word stack, the word queue is also derived from day to day activities. You have most likely seen a queue of people in a supermarket at the billing counter where the last one to come stands at the end and the first one to come is the first one to get their groceries check out. In the similar manner, queue works where the operations are performed at both ends.

A stack is a FIFO data structure which elaborates to First In First Out. A queue, like stack, can either be implemented using arrays or linked list. The three most commonly performed operations on queue are:

· Key Enqueue(Key) — to input data into stack and place them at the bottom.

· Key Dequeue() — to remove the data from the top.

· Key Peek() — to look at the data at the top without removing it.

· Boolean isEmpty(): are there any elements?

# Support for Queue for different programming languages:

Java :- Queue can be implemented using List class in Java

C++ :- Like Java, C++ has also a Standard Template Library called Queue for queue implementation.

Python :- The queue module in python offers the functionality of the queue class. Since queues can be implemented using linked list therefore, llist can also be used.
