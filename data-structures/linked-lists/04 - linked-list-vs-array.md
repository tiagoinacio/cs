# Comparison Between Arrays and Linked List

A list is a different type of data structure from an array.
Instead of storing data in chunks of memory the array requires a contiguous memory space.
If you add an element to an array, it might change the memory location of the entire array, but the data remains intact.
An array gives you the index number, therefore, you can access it directly or sequentially.
Whereas to access any data member you must traverse through the entire list.
