# Planning an Effective API

## Approaches to adding an API

### API Design is Hard

* What functionality to expose
* How to expose it
* How best to expose it
* How to adjust and improve

1 - Bolt-On Strategy (Brute force approach)

2 - Greenfield Strategy (API first)

3 - Facade Strategy (shape existing systems to what you need)

### Modeling API

1 - Don't worry about the tools
2 - Have a consistent process
3 - It doesn't count unless it's written down - documment everything

### Identify Participants

Who they are

Internal / External to the organization

Their needs

### Identifying activities and breaking them into steps

What are our activities?

Clearly reference individual participants
What are they doing
The order of which things are occuring
