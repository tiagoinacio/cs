Complexity","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nComplexity analysis\nAlgorithm complexity is just a way to formally measure how fast a program or algorithm runs.\nWe want to compare algorithms in terms of just what they are: Ideas of how something is computed. Counting milliseconds won't help us in that. It's quite possible that a bad algorithm written in a low-level programming language such as assembly runs much quicker than a good algorithm written in a high-level programming language such as Python or Ruby.\nComplexity analysis is also a tool that allows us to explain how an algorithm behaves as the input grows larger. If we feed it a different input, how will the algorithm behave? If our algorithm takes 1 second to run for an input of size 1000, how will it behave if I double the input size? Will it run just as fast, half as fast, or four times slower?\nWorst-case analysis\nWhen analyzing algorithms, we often consider the worst-case scenario - worst-case analysis. In complexity analysis we only care about what happens to the instruction-counting function as the program input (n) grows large. This really goes along with the previous ideas of \"worst-case scenario\" behavior: We're interested in how our algorithm behaves when treated badly; when it's challenged to do something hard. Notice that this is really useful when comparing algorithms. If an algorithm beats another algorithm for a large input, it's most probably true that the faster algorithm remains faster when given an easier, smaller input. From the terms that we are considering, we'll drop all the terms that grow slowly and only keep the ones that grow fast as n becomes larger.\nIt makes some sense to drop multiplicative constant, such as in 6N, we drop the constant 6. If we think about how different programming languages compile. The \"array lookup\" statement in one language may compile to different instructions in different programming languages. For example, in C, doing A[ i ] does not include a check that i is within the declared array size, while in Pascal it does.\nAsymptotic behavior\nThis filter of \"dropping all factors\" and of \"keeping the largest growing term\" as described above is what we call asymptotic behavior. So the asymptotic behavior of f( n ) = 2n + 8 is described by the function f( n ) = n. Mathematically speaking, what we're saying here is that we're interested in the limit of function f as n tends to infinity. (On a side note, in a strict mathematical setting, we would not be able to drop the constants in the limit; but for computer science purposes, we want to do that for the reasons described above.)\nLet us find the asymptotic behavior of the following example functions by dropping the constant factors and by keeping the terms that grow the fastest.\nf(n) = 5n + 12 gives f(n) = n.\nBy using the exact same reasoning as above.\nf(n) = 109 gives f(n) = 1.\nWe're dropping the multiplier 109 * 1, but we still have to put a 1 here to indicate that this function has a non-zero value.\nf(n) = n2 + 3n + 112 gives f(n) = n2\nHere, n2 grows larger than 3n for sufficiently large n, so we're keeping that.\nf(n) = n3 + 1999n + 1337 gives f(n) = n3\nEven though the factor in front of n is quite large, we can still find a large enough n so that n3 is bigger than 1999n. As we're interested in the behavior for very large values of n, we only keep n3.\nf(n) = n + sqrt(n) gives f(n) = n\nThis is so because n grows faster than sqrt( n ) as we increase n.\nComplexity\nSince we can drop all these decorative constants, it's pretty easy to tell the asymptotic behavior of the instruction-counting function of a program. In fact, any program that doesn't have any loops will have f( n ) = 1, since the number of instructions it needs is just a constant (unless it uses recursion;). Any program with a single loop which goes from 1 to n will have f( n ) = n, since it will do a constant number of instructions before the loop, a constant number of instructions after the loop, and a constant number of instructions within the loop which all run n times.\nThe following PHP program checks to see if a particular value exists within an array A of size n:\n\n\nThis method of searching for a value within an array is called linear search. This is a reasonable name, as this program has f( n ) = n. You may notice that there's a \"break\" statement here that may make the program terminate sooner, even after a single iteration. But recall that we're interested in the worst-case scenario, which for this program is for the array A to not contain the value. So we still have f( n ) = n.\nLet's look at a Python program which adds two array elements together to produce a sum which it stores in another variable:\nv = a[ 0 ] + a[ 1 ]\n\nHere we have a constant number of instructions, so we have f( n ) = 1.\nThe following program in C++ checks to see if a vector (a fancy array) named A of size n contains the same two values anywhere within it:\nbool duplicate = false;\nfor ( int i = 0; i \nAs here we have two nested loops within each other, we'll have an asymptotic behavior described by f( n ) = n2.\n\nSimple programs can be analyzed by counting the nested loops of the program. A single loop over n items yields f( n ) = n. A loop within a loop yields f( n ) = n2. A loop within a loop within a loop yields f( n ) = n3.\n\nIf we have a program that calls a function within a loop and we know the number of instructions the called function performs, it's easy to determine the number of instructions of the whole program. Indeed, let's take a look at this C example:\nint i;\nfor ( i = 0; i \nIf we know that f( n ) is a function that performs exactly n instructions, we can then know that the number of instructions of the whole program is asymptotically n2, as the function is called exactly n times.\n\nGiven a series of for loops that are sequential, the slowest of them determines the asymptotic behavior of the program. Two nested loops followed by a single loop is asymptotically the same as the nested loops alone, because the nested loops dominate the simple loop.\n\nTheta\nWhen we've figured out the exact such f asymptotically, we'll say that our program is Θ( f( n ) ). For example, the above programs are Θ( 1 ), Θ( n2 ) and Θ( n2 ) respectively. Θ( n ) is pronounced \"theta of n\". Sometimes we say that f( n ), the original function counting the instructions including the constants, is Θ( something ). For example, we may say that f( n ) = 2n is a function that is Θ( n ) — nothing new here. We can also write 2n ∈ Θ( n ), which is pronounced as \"two n is theta of n\". Don't get confused about this notation: All it's saying is that if we've counted the number of instructions a program needs and those are 2n, then the asymptotic behavior of our algorithm is described by n, which we found by dropping the constants. Given this notation, the following are some true mathematical statements:\nn6 + 3n ∈ Θ( n6 )\n2n + 12 ∈ Θ( 2n )\n3n + 2n ∈ Θ( 3n )\nnn + n ∈ Θ( nn )\nTime complexity\nWe call this function, i.e. what we put within Θ( here ), the time complexity or just complexity of our algorithm. So an algorithm with Θ( n ) is of complexity n. We also have special names for Θ( 1 ), Θ( n ), Θ( n2 ) and Θ( log( n ) ) because they occur very often. We say that a Θ( 1 ) algorithm is a constant-time algorithm, Θ( n ) is linear, Θ( n2 ) is quadratic and Θ( log( n ) ) is logarithmic.\n\n Programs with a bigger Θ run slower than programs with a smaller Θ.\n\nBig-O notation\nWe will be able to say that the behavior of our algorithm will never exceed a certain bound. This will make life easier for us, as we won't have to specify exactly how fast our algorithm runs, even when ignoring constants the way we did before. All we'll have to do is find a certain bound.\nA famous problem computer scientists use for teaching algorithms is the sorting problem. In the sorting problem, an array A of size n is given and we are asked to write a program that sorts this array.\nHere is an inefficient way to implement sorting an array in Ruby.\nb = []\nn.times do\n    m = a[ 0 ]\n    mi = 0\n    a.each_with_index do |element, i|\n        if element \nThis method is called selection sort. It finds the minimum of our array (the array is denoted a above, while the minimum value is denoted m and mi is its index), puts it at the end of a new array (in our case b), and removes it from the original array. Then it finds the minimum between the remaining values of our original array, appends that to our new array so that it now contains two elements, and removes it from our original array. It continues this process until all items have been removed from the original and have been inserted into the new array, which means that the array has been sorted. In this example, we can see that we have two nested loops. The outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop runs once for each element of the array a. While the array a initially has n items, we remove one array item in each iteration. So the inner loop repeats n times during the first iteration of the outer loop, then n - 1 times, then n - 2 times and so forth, until the last iteration of the outer loop during which it only runs once.\nUpper bound - O\nIt's a little harder to evaluate the complexity of this program, as we'd have to figure out the sum 1 + 2 + ... + (n - 1) + n. But we can for sure find an \"upper bound\" for it. That is, we can alter our program (you can do that in your mind, not in the actual code) to make it worse than it is and then find the complexity of that new program that we derived. If we can find the complexity of the worse program that we've constructed, then we know that our original program is at most that bad, or maybe better. That way, if we find out a pretty good complexity for our altered program, which is worse than our original, we can know that our original program will have a pretty good complexity too – either as good as our altered program or even better.\nLet's now think of the way to edit this example program to make it easier to figure out its complexity. But let's keep in mind that we can only make it worse, i.e. make it take up more instructions, so that our estimate is meaningful for our original program. Clearly we can alter the inner loop of the program to always repeat exactly n times instead of a varying number of times. Some of these repetitions will be useless, but it will help us analyze the complexity of the resulting algorithm. If we make this simple change, then the new algorithm that we've constructed is clearly Θ( n2 ), because we have two nested loops where each repeats exactly n times. If that is so, we say that the original algorithm is O( n2 ). O( n2 ) is pronounced \"big oh of n squared\". What this says is that our program is asymptotically no worse than n2. It may even be better than that, or it may be the same as that. By the way, if our program is indeed Θ( n2 ), we can still say that it's O( n2 ). To help you realize that, imagine altering the original program in a way that doesn't change it much, but still makes it a little worse, such as adding a meaningless instruction at the beginning of the program. Doing this will alter the instruction-counting function by a simple constant, which is ignored when it comes to asymptotic behavior. So a program that is Θ( n2 ) is also O( n2 ).\nBut a program that is O( n2 ) may not be Θ( n2 ). For example, any program that is Θ( n ) is also O( n2 ) in addition to being O( n ). If we imagine the that a Θ( n ) program is a simple for loop that repeats n times, we can make it worse by wrapping it in another for loop which repeats n times as well, thus producing a program with f( n ) = n2. To generalize this, any program that is Θ( a ) is O( b ) when b is worse than a. Notice that our alteration to the program doesn't need to give us a program that is actually meaningful or equivalent to our original program. It only needs to perform more instructions than the original for a given n. All we're using it for is counting instructions, not actually solving our problem.\nSo, saying that our program is O( n2 ) is being on the safe side: We've analyzed our algorithm, and we've found that it's never worse than n2. But it could be that it's in fact n2. This gives us a good estimate of how fast our program runs. Let's go through a few examples to help you familiarize yourself with this new notation.\nA Θ( n ) algorithm is O( n )\nWe know that this is true as our original program was Θ( n ). We can achieve O( n ) without altering our program at all.\n\nA Θ( n ) algorithm is O( n2 )\nAs n2 is worse than n, this is true.\n\nA Θ( n2 ) algorithm is O( n3 )\nAs n3 is worse than n2, this is true.\n\nA Θ( n ) algorithm is O( 1 )\nAs 1 is not worse than n, this is false. If a program takes n instructions asymptotically (a linear number of instructions), we can't make it worse and have it take only 1 instruction asymptotically (a constant number of instructions).\n\nA O( 1 ) algorithm is Θ( 1 )\nThis is true as the two complexities are the same.\n\nA O( n ) algorithm is Θ( 1 )\nThis may or may not be true depending on the algorithm. In the general case it's false. If an algorithm is Θ( 1 ), then it certainly is O( n ). But if it's O( n ) then it may not be Θ( 1 ). For example, a Θ( n ) algorithm is O( n ) but not Θ( 1 ).\nTight bound - Θ\nBecause the O-complexity of an algorithm gives an upper bound for the actual complexity of an algorithm, while Θ gives the actual complexity of an algorithm, we sometimes say that the Θ gives us a tight bound. If we know that we've found a complexity bound that is not tight, we can also use a lower-case o to denote that. For example, if an algorithm is Θ( n ), then its tight complexity is n. Then this algorithm is both O( n ) and O( n2 ). As the algorithm is Θ( n ), the O( n ) bound is a tight one. But the O( n2 ) bound is not tight, and so we can write that the algorithm is o( n2 ), which is pronounced \"small o of n squared\" to illustrate that we know our bound is not tight. It's better if we can find tight bounds for our algorithms, as these give us more information about how our algorithm behaves, but it's not always easy to do.\nA Θ( n ) algorithm for which we found a O( n ) upper bound.\nIn this case, the Θ complexity and the O complexity are the same, so the bound is tight.\n\nA Θ( n2 ) algorithm for which we found a O( n3 ) upper bound.\nHere we see that the O complexity is of a larger scale than the Θ complexity so this bound is not tight. Indeed, a bound of O( n2 ) would be a tight one. So we can write that the algorithm is o( n3 ).\n\nA Θ( 1 ) algorithm for which we found an O( n ) upper bound.\nAgain we see that the O complexity is of a larger scale than the Θ complexity so we have a bound that isn't tight. A bound of O( 1 ) would be a tight one. So we can point out that the O( n ) bound is not tight by writing it as o( n ).\n\nA Θ( n ) algorithm for which we found an O( 1 ) upper bound.\nWe must have made a mistake in calculating this bound, as it's wrong. It's impossible for a Θ( n ) algorithm to have an upper bound of O( 1 ), as n is a larger complexity than 1. Remember that O gives an upper bound.\n\nA Θ( n ) algorithm for which we found an O( 2n ) upper bound.\nThis may seem like a bound that is not tight, but this is not actually true. This bound is in fact tight. Recall that the asymptotic behavior of 2n and n are the same, and that O and Θ are only concerned with asymptotic behavior. So we have that O( 2n ) = O( n ) and therefore this bound is tight as the complexity is the same as the Θ.\n\nIt's easier to figure out the O-complexity of an algorithm than its Θ-complexity.\n\nLower Bound - Ω / ω\nLet's introduce just two more symbols before we move on to a few examples. These are easy now that you know Θ, O and o, and we won't use them much later in this article, but it's good to know them now that we're at it. In the example above, we modified our program to make it worse (i.e. taking more instructions and therefore more time) and created the O notation. O is meaningful because it tells us that our program will never be slower than a specific bound, and so it provides valuable information so that we can argue that our program is good enough. If we do the opposite and modify our program to make it better and find out the complexity of the resulting program, we use the notation Ω. Ω therefore gives us a complexity that we know our program won't be better than. This is useful if we want to prove that a program runs slowly or an algorithm is a bad one. This can be useful to argue that an algorithm is too slow to use in a particular case. For example, saying that an algorithm is Ω( n3 ) means that the algorithm isn't better than n3. It might be Θ( n3 ), as bad as Θ( n4 ) or even worse, but we know it's at least somewhat bad. So Ω gives us a lower bound for the complexity of our algorithm. Similarly to ο, we can write ω if we know that our bound isn't tight. For example, a Θ( n3 ) algorithm is ο( n4 ) and ω( n2 ). Ω( n ) is pronounced \"big omega of n\", while ω( n ) is pronounced \"small omega of n\".\nFor the following Θ complexities write down a tight and a non-tight O bound, and a tight and non-tight Ω bound of your choice, providing they exist.\nΘ( 1 ) - The tight bounds will be O( 1 ) and Ω( 1 ). A non-tight O-bound would be O( n ). Recall that O gives us an upper bound. As n is of larger scale than 1 this is a non-tight bound and we can write it as o( n ) as well. But we cannot find a non-tight bound for Ω, as we can't get lower than 1 for these functions. So we'll have to do with the tight bound.\n\nΘ( sqrt( n ) ) - The tight bounds will have to be the same as the Θ complexity, so they are O( sqrt( n ) ) and Ω( sqrt( n ) ) respectively. For non-tight bounds we can have O( n ), as n is larger than sqrt( n ) and so it is an upper bound for sqrt( n ). As we know this is a non-tight upper bound, we can also write it as o( n ). For a lower bound that is not tight, we can simply use Ω( 1 ). As we know that this bound is not tight, we can also write it as ω( 1 ).\n\nΘ( n ) - The tight bounds are O( n ) and Ω( n ). Two non-tight bounds could be ω( 1 ) and o( n3 ). These are in fact pretty bad bounds, as they are far from the original complexities, but they are still valid using our definitions.\n\nΘ( n2 ) - The tight bounds are O( n2 ) and Ω( n2 ). For non-tight bounds we could again use ω( 1 ) and o( n3 ) as in our previous example.\n\nΘ( n3 ) - The tight bounds are O( n3 ) and Ω( n3 ) respectively. Two non-tight bounds could be ω( sqrt( n ) n2 ) and o( sqrt( n ) n3 ). Although these bounds are not tight, they're better than the ones we gave above.\nThe reason we use O and Ω instead of Θ even though O and Ω can also give tight bounds is that we may not be able to tell if a bound we've found is tight, or we may just not want to go through the process of scrutinizing it so much.\n\n\n\nAsymptotic comparison operator\nNumeric comparison operator\n\n\n\n\nOur algorithm is o( something )\nA number is \n\n\nOur algorithm is O( something )\nA number is ≤ something\n\n\nOur algorithm is Θ( something )\nA number is = something\n\n\nOur algorithm is Ω( something )\nA number is ≥ something\n\n\nOur algorithm is ω( something )\nA number is > something\n\n\n\nWhile all the symbols O, o, Ω, ω and Θ are useful at times, O is the one used more commonly, as it's easier to determine than Θ and more practically useful than Ω.\nLogarithms\nA logarithm is an operation applied to a number that makes it quite smaller – much like a square root of a number. So if there's one thing you want to remember about logarithms is that they take a number and make it much smaller than the original. Now, in the same way that square roots are the inverse operation of squaring something, logarithms are the inverse operation of exponentiating something.\n2^x = 1024\nWe now wish to solve this equation for x. So we ask ourselves: What is the number to which we must raise the base 2 so that we get 1024? That number is 10. Indeed, we have 2^10 = 1024, which is easy to verify. Logarithms help us denote this problem using new notation. In this case, 10 is the logarithm of 1024 and we write this as log( 1024 ) and we read it as \"the logarithm of 1024\". Because we're using 2 as a base, these logarithms are called base 2 logarithms. There are logarithms in other bases.\n\nSolve the equations below. Denote what logarithm you're finding in each case. Use only logarithms base 2.\n2^x = 64\nBy trial and error we can find that x = 6 and so log( 64 ) = 6.\n\n(2^2)^x = 64\nHere we notice that (22)x, by the properties of exponents, can be written as 22x. So we have that 2x = 6 because log( 64 ) = 6 from the previous result and therefore x = 3.\n\n4^x = 4\nUsing our knowledge from the previous equation, we can write 4 as 22 and so our equation becomes (22)x = 4 which is the same as 22x = 4. Then we notice that log( 4 ) = 2 because 22 = 4 and therefore we have that 2x = 2. So x = 1. This is readily observed from the original equation, as using an exponent of 1 yields the base as a result.\n\n2^x = 1\nRecall that an exponent of 0 yields a result of 1. So we have log( 1 ) = 0 as 20 = 1, and so x = 0.\n\n2^x + 2^x = 32\nHere we have a sum and so we can't take the logarithm directly. However we notice that 2x + 2x is the same as 2 * (2x). So we've multiplied in yet another two, and therefore this is the same as 2x + 1 and now all we have to do is solve the equation 2x + 1 = 32. We find that log( 32 ) = 5 and so x + 1 = 5 and therefore x = 4.\n\n(2^x) * (2^x) = 64\nWe're multiplying together two powers of 2, and so we can join them by noticing that (2x) * (2x) is the same as 22x. Then all we need to do is to solve the equation 22x = 64 which we already solved above and so x = 3.\nFor competition algorithms implemented in C++, once you've analyzed your complexity, you can get a rough estimate of how fast your program will run by expecting it to perform about 1,000,000 operations per second, where the operations you count are given by the asymptotic behavior function describing your algorithm. For example, a Θ( n ) algorithm takes about a second to process the input for n = 1,000,000.\nRecursive complexity\nA recursive function is a function that calls itself. Can we analyze its complexity? The following function, written in Python, evaluates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a positive integer number is found by multiplying it with all the previous positive integers together. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5  4  3  2  1. We denote that \"5!\" and pronounce it \"five factorial\".\ndef factorial( n ):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    return n * factorial( n - 1 )\n\nThis function doesn't have any loops in it, but its complexity isn't constant either. What we need to do to find out its complexity is again to go about counting instructions. Clearly, if we pass some n to this function, it will execute itself n times. If you're unsure about that, run it \"by hand\" now for n = 5 to validate that it actually works. For example, for n = 5, it will execute 5 times, as it will keep decreasing n by 1 in each call. We can see therefore that this function is then Θ( n ).\n\nIf you're unsure about this fact, remember that you can always find the exact complexity by counting instructions. If you wish, you can now try to count the actual instructions performed by this function to find a function f( n ) and see that it's indeed linear (recall that linear means Θ( n )).\nLogarithmic complexity\nOne famous problem in computer science is that of searching for a value within an array. We solved this problem earlier for the general case. This problem becomes interesting if we have an array which is sorted and we want to find a given value within it. One method to do that is called binary search. We look at the middle element of our array: If we find it there, we're done. Otherwise, if the value we find there is bigger than the value we're looking for, we know that our element will be on the left part of the array. Otherwise, we know it'll be on the right part of the array. We can keep cutting these smaller arrays in halves until we have a single element to look at. Here's the method using pseudocode:\ndef binarySearch( A, n, value ):\n    if n = 1:\n        if A[ 0 ] = value:\n            return true\n        else:\n            return false\n    if value  A[ n / 2 ]:\n        return binarySearch( A[ ( n / 2 + 1 )...n ], n / 2 - 1, value )\n    else:\n        return true\n\n\nThis pseudocode is a simplification of the actual implementation. In practice, this method is easier described than implemented, as the programmer needs to take care of some implementation issues. There are off-by-one errors and the division by 2 may not always produce an integer value and so it's necessary to floor() or ceil() the value. But we can assume for our purposes that it will always succeed, and we'll assume our actual implementation in fact takes care of the off-by-one errors, as we only want to analyze the complexity of this method.\nLet us now attempt to analyze this algorithm. Again, we have a recursive algorithm in this case. Let's assume, for simplicity, that the array is always cut in exactly a half, ignoring just now the + 1 and - 1 part in the recursive call. By now you should be convinced that a little change such as ignoring + 1 and - 1 won't affect our complexity results. This is a fact that we would normally have to prove if we wanted to be prudent from a mathematical point of view, but practically it is intuitively obvious. Let's assume that our array has a size that is an exact power of 2, for simplicity. Again this assumption doesn't change the final results of our complexity that we will arrive at. The worst-case scenario for this problem would happen when the value we're looking for does not occur in our array at all. In that case, we'd start with an array of size n in the first call of the recursion, then get an array of size n / 2 in the next call. Then we'll get an array of size n / 4 in the next recursive call, followed by an array of size n / 8 and so forth. In general, our array is split in half in every call, until we reach 1. So, let's write the number of elements in our array for every call:\n0th iteration: n\n1st iteration: n / 2\n2nd iteration: n / 4\n3rd iteration: n / 8\n...\nith iteration: n / 2^i\n...\nlast iteration: 1\nNotice that in the i-th iteration, our array has n / 2^i elements. This is because in every iteration we're cutting our array into half, meaning we're dividing its number of elements by two. This translates to multiplying the denominator with a 2. If we do that i times, we get n / 2^i. Now, this procedure continues and with every larger i we get a smaller number of elements until we reach the last iteration in which we have only 1 element left. If we wish to find i to see in what iteration this will take place, we have to solve the following equation:\n1 = n / 2^i\nThis will only be true when we have reached the final call to the binarySearch() function, not in the general case. So solving for i here will help us find in which iteration the recursion will finish. Multiplying both sides by 2^i we get:\n2^i = n\nNow, this equation should look familiar if you read the logarithms section above. Solving for i we have:\ni = log( n )\nThis tells us that the number of iterations required to perform a binary search is log( n ) where n is the number of elements in the original array.\nIf you think about it, this makes some sense. For example, take n = 32, an array of 32 elements. How many times do we have to cut this in half to get only 1 element? We get: 32 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1. We did this 5 times, which is the logarithm of 32. Therefore, the complexity of binary search is Θ( log( n ) ).\nThis last result allows us to compare binary search with linear search, our previous method. Clearly, as log( n ) is much smaller than n, it is reasonable to conclude that binary search is a much faster method to search within an array then linear search, so it may be advisable to keep our arrays sorted if we want to do many searches within them.\n\nImproving the asymptotic running time of a program often tremendously increases its performance, much more than any smaller \"technical\" optimizations such as using a faster programming language.\n\nOptimal sorting\nWe looked at a sorting implementation above called a selection sort. We mentioned that selection sort is not optimal. An optimal algorithm is an algorithm that solves a problem in the best possible way, meaning there are no better algorithms for this. This means that all other algorithms for solving the problem have a worse or equal complexity to that optimal algorithm. There may be many optimal algorithms for a problem that all share the same complexity. The sorting problem can be solved optimally in various ways. We can use the same idea as with binary search to sort quickly. This sorting method is called mergesort.\nTo perform a mergesort, we will first need to build a helper function that we will then use to do the actual sorting. We will make a merge function which takes two arrays that are both already sorted and merges them together into a big sorted array. This is easily done:\ndef merge( A, B ):\n    if empty( A ):\n        return B\n    if empty( B ):\n        return A\n    if A[ 0 ] \nThe concat function takes an item, the \"head\", and an array, the \"tail\", and builds up and returns a new array which contains the given \"head\" item as the first thing in the new array and the given \"tail\" item as the rest of the elements in the array. For example, concat( 3, [ 4, 5, 6 ] ) returns [ 3, 4, 5, 6 ]. We use A_n and B_n to denote the sizes of arrays A and B respectively.\nAnalyzing this algorithm reveals that it has a running time of Θ( n ), where n is the length of the resulting array (n = A_n + B_n).\nUtilizing this function we can build a better sorting algorithm. The idea is the following: We split the array into two parts. We sort each of the two parts recursively, then we merge the two sorted arrays into one big array. In pseudocode:\ndef mergeSort( A, n ):\n    if n = 1:\n        return A # it is already sorted\n    middle = floor( n / 2 )\n    leftHalf = A[ 1...middle ]\n    rightHalf = A[ ( middle + 1 )...n ]\n    return merge( mergeSort( leftHalf, middle ), mergeSort( rightHalf, n - middle ) )\n\nIn every step of mergeSort, we're splitting the array into two halves of equal size, similarly to binarySearch. However, in this case, we maintain both halves throughout execution. We then apply the algorithm recursively in each half. After the recursion returns, we apply the merge operation on the result which takes Θ( n ) time.\nSo, we split the original array into two arrays of size n / 2 each. Then we merge those arrays, an operation that merges n elements and thus takes Θ( n ) time.\n\nLet's see what's going on here. Each circle represents a call to the mergeSort function. The number written in the circle indicates the size of the array that is being sorted. The top blue circle is the original call to mergeSort, where we get to sort an array of size n. The arrows indicate recursive calls made between functions. The original call to mergeSort makes two calls to mergeSort on two arrays, each of size n / 2. This is indicated by the two arrows at the top. In turn, each of these calls makes two calls of its own to mergeSort two arrays of size n / 4 each, and so forth until we arrive at arrays of size 1. This diagram is called a recursion tree, because it illustrates how the recursion behaves and looks like a tree (the root is at the top and the leaves are at the bottom, so in reality it looks like an inversed tree).\nNotice that at each row in the above diagram, the total number of elements is n. To see this, take a look at each row individually. The first row contains only one call to mergeSort with an array of size n, so the total number of elements is n. The second row has two calls to mergeSort each of size n / 2. But n / 2 + n / 2 = n and so again in this row the total number of elements is n. In the third row, we have 4 calls each of which is applied on an n / 4-sized array, yielding a total number of elements equal to n / 4 + n / 4 + n / 4 + n / 4 = 4n / 4 = n. So again we get n elements. Now notice that at each row in this diagram the caller will have to perform a merge operation on the elements returned by the callees. For example, the circle indicated with red color has to sort n / 2 elements. To do this, it splits the n / 2-sized array into two n / 4-sized arrays, calls mergeSort recursively to sort those (these calls are the circles indicated with green color), then merges them together. This merge operation requires to merge n / 2 elements. At each row in our tree, the total number of elements merged is n. In the row that we just explored, our function merges n / 2 elements and the function on its right (which is in blue color) also has to merge n / 2 elements of its own. That yields n elements in total that need to be merged for the row we're looking at.\nBy this argument, the complexity for each row is Θ( n ). We know that the number of rows in this diagram, also called the depth of the recursion tree, will be log( n ). The reasoning for this is exactly the same as the one we used when analyzing the complexity of binary search. We have log( n ) rows and each of them is Θ( n ), therefore the complexity of mergeSort is Θ( n  log( n ) ). This is much better than Θ( n2 ) which is what selection sort gave us (remember that log( n ) is much smaller than n, and so n  log( n ) is much smaller than n * n = n2).\nAs you saw in this last example, complexity analysis allows us to compare algorithms to see which one is better. Under these circumstances, we can now be pretty certain that merge sort will outperform selection sort for large arrays. This conclusion would be hard to draw if we didn't have the theoretical background of algorithm analysis that we developed. In practice, indeed sorting algorithms of running time Θ( n * log( n ) ) are used. For example, the Linux kernel uses a sorting algorithm called heapsort, which has the same running time as mergesort which we explored here, namely Θ( n log( n ) ) and so is optimal. Notice that we have not proven that these sorting algorithms are optimal. Doing this requires a slightly more involved mathematical argument, but rest assured that they can't get any better from a complexity point of view.\nFormal definition\nA function T(N) is O(F(N)) if for some constant c and for values of N greater than some value n0:\nT(N) \nSuppose f(x) and g(x) are two functions defined on some subset of the real numbers. We write\nf(x) = O(g(x))\nor\nf(x) = O(g(x)) for x -> ∞\nIntuitively, this means that f does not grow faster than g.\nNames of Bounding Functions\nBig O (O) is the upper bound of a function.\nBig omega (Ω) is the lower bound of a function.\nBig theta (Ɵ) is in the middle of Big O and Big Ω.\ng(n) = O(f(n)) means C x f(n) is an upper bound on g(n).\ng(n) = Ω(f(n)) means C x f(n) is a lower bound on g(n).\ng(n) = Ɵ(f(n)) means C1 x f(n) is an upper bound on g(n) and C2 x f(n) is a lower bound on g(n). It's a tight bound.\nC, C1, C2 are all constants independent of n.\nThis definitions imply a contant n0 beyond which they are satisfied. We do not care about small values of n.\n\nEach of these complexities defines a numerical function: time vs. size.\nOrders\n\n\n\nnotation\nname\n\n\n\n\nO(1)\nconstant\n\n\nO(log(n))\nlogarithmic\n\n\nO((log(n))^c)\npolylogarithmic\n\n\nO(n)\nlinear\n\n\nO(n^2)\nquadratic\n\n\nO(n^c)\npolynomial\n\n\nO(c^n)\nexponential\n\n\n\nNote, too, that O(log n) is exactly the same as O(log(n^c)).

In comparison, a data structure is a concrete implementation of the space provided by an ADT.\nDifferent kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.\nData structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.\nImplementation\nData structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointer—a bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations; while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself. Many data structures use both principles, sometimes combined in non-trivial ways (as in XOR linking).\nThe implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an abstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).\nExamples\nThere are numerous types of data structures, generally built upon simpler primitive data types:\n\nAn array is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type (depending on the language, individual elements may either all be forced to be the same type, or may be of almost any type). Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required. Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.\nA linked list (also just called list) is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array, is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as random access to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.\nA record (also called tuple or struct) is an aggregate data structure. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members.\nA union is a data structure that specifies which of a number of permitted primitive types may be stored in its instances, e.g. float or long integer. Contrast with a record, which could be defined to contain a float and an integer; whereas in a union, there is only one value at a time. Enough space is allocated to contain the widest member datatype.\nA tagged union (also called variant, variant record, discriminated union, or disjoint union) contains an additional field indicating its current type, for enhanced type safety.\nAn object is a data structure that contains data fields, like a record, as well as various methods which operate on the contents of the record. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from objects.\n\nIn addition, graphs and binary trees are other commonly used data structures.\nLanguage support\nMost assembly languages and some low-level languages, such as BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language), lack built-in support for data structures. On the other hand, many high-level programming languages and some higher-level assembly languages, such as MASM, have special syntax or other built-in support for certain data structures, such as records and arrays. For example, the C (a direct descendant of BCPL) and Pascal languages support structs and records, respectively, in addition to vectors (one-dimensional arrays) and multi-dimensional arrays.\nMost programming languages feature some sort of library mechanism that allows data structure implementations to be reused by different programs. Modern languages usually come with standard libraries that implement the most common data structures. Examples are the C++ Standard Template Library, the Java Collections Framework, and the Microsoft .NET Framework.\nModern languages also generally support modular programming, the separation between the interface of a library module and its implementation. Some provide opaque data types that allow clients to hide implementation details. Object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Smalltalk, typically use classes for this purpose.\nMany known data structures have concurrent versions which allow multiple computing threads to access a single concrete instance of a data structure simultaneously.\nThe 5 requirements of any data structure\n\nHow to Access (one item / all items)\nHow to Insert (at end / at position)\nHow to Delete (from end / from position)\nHow to Find (if exists / what location)\nHow to Sort (sort in place / created sorted version)\n\n"},"data-structures/arrays/":{"url":"data-structures/arrays/","title":"Arrays","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nSummary\nArray is a contiguous area of memory either on the stack or on the heap, broken down into equal sized elements, and each of those elements is indexed by contigous integer.\nA basic data structure which one uses in a day to day programming is an array. An array can hold a fixed number of containers to store data and operations could be performed on that data according to the user’s needs.\n\nIn the picture above, an array is defined with the name arrayName and has an integer data type. The number below in the bold shows the memory address each container of an array is assigned to. The important thing here to remember is an array index always starts at 0 and ends at (total array size -1). So, let’s just say you defined an array of length 5, arrayName[5], then the indexes of this array would be arrayName[0], arrayName[1], arrayName[2], arrayName[3], arrayName[4].\nSimplest arrays are fixed size (immutable), which that we can't add or remove elements.\nIt can be zero based indexed or one based indexed.\nConstant-time acces to read and constant-time access to write O(1).\nEvery element needs to be the same size, so we can do pointer arithmetic and have O(1) to read and write.\nIf each element had a diferent size, we would need to go through each one and sum all together. This would represent a O(n) time.\nTo read get the memory address of an element in the array, given an index that we are interest in named i, and first_index as a 0 or 1 (depending if it is zero based array or not):\narray_address + element_size x (i - first_index)\nDefinition\nIn computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.\nFor example, an array of 10 32-bit integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ... 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + 4 × i.\nThe memory address of the first element of an array is called first address or foundation address.\nBecause the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices. In some cases the term \"vector\" is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially lookup tables; the word table is sometimes used as a synonym of array.\nArrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.\nArrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually,[3][5] but not always,[2] fixed while the array is in use.\nThe term array is often used to mean array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.\nThe term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or \"abstract array\", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays. Arrays have better cache locality as compared to linked lists.\nApplications\nArrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables. Many databases, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are records.\nArrays are used to implement other data structures, such as lists, heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks, strings, and VLists. Array-based implementations of other data structures are frequently simple and space-efficient (implicit data structures), requiring little space overhead, but may have poor space complexity, particularly when modified, compared to tree-based data structures (compare a sorted array to a search tree).\nOne or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program dynamic memory allocation, particularly memory pool allocation. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate \"dynamic memory\" portably.\nArrays can be used to determine partial or complete control flow in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive) multiple IF statements. They are known in this context as control tables and are used in conjunction with a purpose built interpreter whose control flow is altered according to values contained in the array. The array may contain subroutine pointers (or relative subroutine numbers that can be acted upon by SWITCH statements) that direct the path of the execution.\nElement identifier and addressing formulas\nWhen data objects are stored in an array, individual objects are selected by an index that is usually a non-negative scalar integer. Indexes are also called subscripts. An index maps the array value to a stored object.\nThere are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed:\n\n0 (zero-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 0.[8]\n1 (one-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 1.[9]\nn (n-based indexing): The base index of an array can be freely chosen. Usually programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index.\n\nUsing zero based indexing is design choice of many influential programming languages, including C, Java and Lisp. This leads to simpler implementation where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero.\nArrays can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to access an array using multiple indices. For example, a two-dimensional array A with three rows and four columns might provide access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression A[1][3] in the case of a zero-based indexing system. Thus two indices are used for a two-dimensional array, three for a three-dimensional array, and n for an n-dimensional array.\nThe number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or rank of the array.\nIn standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some enumerated type), and the address of an element is computed by a \"linear\" formula on the indices.\nOne-dimensional arrays\nA one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array. Accessing its elements involves a single subscript which can either represent a row or column index.\nAs an example consider the C declaration int anArrayName[10];\nSyntax : datatype anArrayname[sizeofArray];\nIn the given example the array can contain 10 elements of any value available to the int type. In C, the array element indices are 0-9 inclusive in this case. For example, the expressions anArrayName[0] and anArrayName[9] are the first and last elements respectively.\nFor a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the address B + c × i, where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the address increment or stride.\nIf the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant B is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the C programming language specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element \"zeroth\" rather than \"first\".\nHowever, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address B. For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address B is replaced by B + 30c, then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35. If the numbering does not start at 0, the constant B may not be the address of any element.\nMulti-dimensional arrays\nFor a multidimensional array, the element with indices i,j would have address B + c · i + d · j, where the coefficients c and d are the row and column address increments, respectively.\nMore generally, in a k-dimensional array, the address of an element with indices i1, i2, ..., ik is\nB + c1 · i1 + c2 · i2 + ... + ck · ik.\nFor example: int a[2][3];\nThis means that array a has 2 rows and 3 columns, and the array is of integer type. Here we can store 6 elements they are stored linearly but starting from first row linear then continuing with second row. The above array will be stored as a11, a12, a13, a21, a22, a23.\nThis formula requires only k multiplications and k additions, for any array that can fit in memory. Moreover, if any coefficient is a fixed power of 2, the multiplication can be replaced by bit shifting.\nThe coefficients ck must be chosen so that every valid index tuple maps to the address of a distinct element.\nIf the minimum legal value for every index is 0, then B is the address of the element whose indices are all zero. As in the one-dimensional case, the element indices may be changed by changing the base address B. Thus, if a two-dimensional array has rows and columns indexed from 1 to 10 and 1 to 20, respectively, then replacing B by B + c1 - − 3 c1 will cause them to be renumbered from 0 through 9 and 4 through 23, respectively. Taking advantage of this feature, some languages (like FORTRAN 77) specify that array indices begin at 1, as in mathematical tradition while other languages (like Fortran 90, Pascal and Algol) let the user choose the minimum value for each index.\nMulti-dimensional arrays are arrays of arrays. Like a grid, a matrix or a table. Like a rectangular of n-dimensional arrays.\n\nHow do we find the address of an element? There are a couple of alternatives.\nRow major\nIf the elements are stored by row (let's say that we have the first row elements, then the second row elements, etc.), we would need to:\n\nFirst, we need to skip the full rows that we are not interested in.\nThen, we need to skip the elements in the same row.\n\nLike this:\narray_address + element_size x ((row - 1 x elements_per_row) + i - first_index).\n(1, 1)\n(1, 2)\n(1, 3)\n(1, 4)\n(1, 5)\n(1, 6)\n(2, 1)\n(2, 2)\n...\nColumn major\nIf the elements are stored by column (let's say that we have the first column elements, then the second column elements, etc.), we would need to:\n\nFirst, we need to skip the full columns that we are not interested in.\nThen, we need to skip the elements in the same column.\n\nLike this:\narray_address + element_size x ((column - 1 x elements_per_column) + i - first_index).\n(1, 1)\n(2, 1)\n(3, 1)\n(1, 2)\n(2, 2)\n(3, 2)\n(1, 3)\n(2, 3)\n...\nJagged arrays\nSometimes, we do not want to have a rectangular multidimensional array. Because we may want arrays width different sizes. If we have a multi dimensional array representing the days in each month, we would end up with arrays with 31, 30, 27 and elements.\nJagged arrays are arrays of arrays with different lengths. We often need programming logic to create this type of data structure.\n\nResizable arrays\nIt's common in many languages that when a basic array is created it cannot be resized. What many languages to in the background is create a new array, with more memory, to fit in the new elements. This is an order N operation.\n\nThe idea is to store a pointer to a dynamically allocated array, and replace it with a newly-allocated array as needed.\n\nDynamic array is an abstract data type with the following operations (at a minimum):\n\nGet(i): returns element at location i in constant-time O(1).\nSet(i, val): sets element i to val in constant-time O(1).\nPushBack(i):  adds val to the end of the array in linear time O(n).\nRemove(i): removes element at location i in linear time O(n).\nSize(): the number of elements in the array in constant-time O(1).\n\nImplementation\nStore:\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\narr\ndynamically-allocated array\n\n\ncapacity\nsize of the dynamically-allocated array\n\n\nsize\nnumber of elements currently in the array\n\n\n\nExample by duplicating the capacity:\nStart with capacity of 2, and size 0.\nPushBack(a) -> size: 1, capacity: 2.\nPushBack(b) -> size: 2, capacity: 2.\nPushBack(c) -> allocate a new dynamically allocated array with capacity 4 and size 3\nPushBack(d) -> size: 4, capacity: 4\nPushBack(e) -> allocate a new dynamically allocated array with capacity 8 and size 4\n\n\n\nGet(i)\n\n\n\n\nif i \n\n\n  Error: index out of range\n\n\nreturn arr[i]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet(i, val)\n\n\n\n\nif i \n\n\n  Error: index out of range\n\n\narr[i] = val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPushBack(val)\n\n\n\n\nif size = capacity:\n\n\n  allocate new_arr[2 x capacity]\n\n\n  for i from 0 to size - 1:\n\n\n    new_arr[i] \n\n\n  free arr\n\n\n  arr \n\n\narr[size] \n\n\nsize \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove(i)\n\n\n\n\nif i \n\n\n  Error: index out of range\n\n\nfor j from i to size - 2:\n\n\n  arr[j] \n\n\nsize \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize()\n\n\n\n\nreturn size\n\n\n\nResizable Array Implementation\nPointer Arithmetic Implementation\nSummary:\nUnlike static arrays, dynamic arrays can be resized.\nAppending a new element to a dynamic array is often constant time, but can take O(n).\nSome space is wasted, at the most half of the space is wasted.\nResize can also be done to shrink the array.\nEfficiency\nBoth store and select take (deterministic worst case) constant time. Arrays take linear (O(n)) space in the number of elements n that they hold.\nIn an array with element size k and on a machine with a cache line size of B bytes, iterating through an array of n elements requires the minimum of ceiling(nk/B) cache misses, because its elements occupy contiguous memory locations. This is roughly a factor of B/k better than the number of cache misses needed to access n elements at random memory locations. As a consequence, sequential iteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration over many other data structures, a property called locality of reference (this does not mean however, that using a perfect hash or trivial hash within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in constant time). Libraries provide low-level optimized facilities for copying ranges of memory (such as memcpy) which can be used to move contiguous blocks of array elements significantly faster than can be achieved through individual element access. The speedup of such optimized routines varies by array element size, architecture, and implementation.\nMemory-wise, arrays are compact data structures with no per-element overhead. There may be a per-array overhead, e.g. to store index bounds, but this is language-dependent. It can also happen that elements stored in an array require less memory than the same elements stored in individual variables, because several array elements can be stored in a single word; such arrays are often called packed arrays. An extreme (but commonly used) case is the bit array, where every bit represents a single element. A single octet can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form.\nArray accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of data parallelism.\nTime for common operations\n\n\n\n\nAdd\nRemove\n\n\n\n\nBeginning\nO(n)\nO(n)\n\n\nEnd*\nO(1) / O(n)\nO(1)/O(n)\n\n\nMiddle\nO(n)\nO(n)\n\n\n\nIf we need to add or remove an element from the beginning or middle of an array, we would need to shift each element, so that is done in linear time, order N operation, because we need to pass through each element in the worst case scenario.\nIf we need to remove or add at the end, that is done in constant-time, order 1 operation, altough, sometimes we may need to create a new array, which may run in linear time.\nSpace\nArrays are contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance. Space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if we have 2n, we still get O(n).\nDimension\nThe dimension of an array is the number of indices needed to select an element. Thus, if the array is seen as a function on a set of possible index combinations, it is the dimension of the space of which its domain is a discrete subset. Thus a one-dimensional array is a list of data, a two-dimensional array a rectangle of data, a three-dimensional array a block of data, etc.\nThis should not be confused with the dimension of the set of all matrices with a given domain, that is, the number of elements in the array. For example, an array with 5 rows and 4 columns is two-dimensional, but such matrices form a 20-dimensional space. Similarly, a three-dimensional vector can be represented by a one-dimensional array of size three.\nResources:\nCoursera\nIntroduction to data structures\nWikipedia\n"},"data-structures/linked-lists/":{"url":"data-structures/linked-lists/","title":"Linked Lists","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nSummary\nLinked lists, it's named kind of like links in a chain, right, so we've got a head pointer that points to a node that then has some data and points to another node, points to another node and eventually points to one that doesn't point any farther.\n\nA linked list is a collection of nodes that are connected by links. Linked list contains node which store the data items and the address to the next node. The first node is usually referred to as the head node and the last node is referred to as the tail node. The pointer of the head node points to the next node and the pointer of the tail node points to Null.\n\nThe dynamics of this data structure makes it easier to add or remove nodes from the end. In order to add/remove a node, you just need to keep track of the previous node and the node after and adjust the pointers accordingly.\nDefinition\nIn computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists.\nLinked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without using a linked list as the basis.\n\nThe principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk, while restructuring an array at run-time is a much more expensive operation. Linked lists allow insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list, and allow doing so with a constant number of operations by keeping the link previous to the link being added or removed in memory during list traversal.\nOn the other hand, since simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to the data or any form of efficient indexing, many basic operations—such as obtaining the last node of the list, finding a node that contains a given datum, or locating the place where a new node should be inserted—may require iterating through most or all of the list elements. The advantages and disadvantages of using linked lists are given below.\nDisadvantages\nThey use more memory than arrays because of the storage used by their pointers.\nNodes in a linked list must be read in order from the beginning as linked lists are inherently sequential access.\nNodes are stored incontiguously, greatly increasing the time periods required to access individual elements within the list, especially with a CPU cache.\nDifficulties arise in linked lists when it comes to reverse traversing. For instance, singly linked lists are cumbersome to navigate backwards[1] and while doubly linked lists are somewhat easier to read, memory is consumed in allocating space for a back-pointer.\nSingly linked list\nEach record of a linked list is often called an 'element' or 'node'.\nThe field of each node that contains the address of the next node is usually called the 'next link' or 'next pointer'. The remaining fields are known as the 'data', 'information', 'value', 'cargo', or 'payload' fields.\nThe 'head' of a list is its first node. The 'tail' of a list may refer either to the rest of the list after the head, or to the last node in the list. In Lisp and some derived languages, the next node may be called the 'cdr' (pronounced could-er) of the list, while the payload of the head node may be called the 'car'.\nSingly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.\n\nA singly linked list whose nodes contain two fields: an integer value and a link to the next node\nOperations\n\nPushFront\n1 - Create a node \n2 - Update our next pointer of that node to point to the head \n3 - Update the head pointer to point to our new node \nAllocate, update one pointer, update another pointer, constant time.

The picture below can give you a brief idea of what the structure should look like.\n\nIn the case of a doubly linked list, the previous pointer of the head node points to Null and the next pointer of the tail points to Null. The previous pointer makes it easier to traverse in either direction. So, node addition and removal become super easy, all you need to do is keep track of the previous node and the next node and adjust the pointer accordingly.\nBi-directional pointers, to the next node and previous node.\nThe Linked-List contains a key, next pointer a previous pointer to go forward or go backwards.\n\nA doubly linked list whose nodes contain three fields: an integer value, the link forward to the next node, and the link backward to the previous node\nPopBack is now order 1, constant-time.\nA technique known as XOR-linking allows a doubly linked list to be implemented using a single link field in each node. However, this technique requires the ability to do bit operations on addresses, and therefore may not be available in some high-level languages.\nMany modern operating systems use doubly linked lists to maintain references to active processes, threads, and other dynamic objects. A common strategy for rootkits to evade detection is to unlink themselves from these lists.\nOperations\nPushBack(key)\nnode PopBack()\nif head = nil:\n    ERROR: emtpy list\nif head = tail:\n    head AddAfter(node, key)\nnode2 Multiply linked list\nIn a 'multiply linked list', each node contains two or more link fields, each field being used to connect the same set of data records in a different order of same set(e.g., by name, by department, by date of birth, etc.). While doubly linked lists can be seen as special cases of multiply linked list, the fact that the two and more orders are opposite to each other leads to simpler and more efficient algorithms, so they are usually treated as a separate case.\nCircular linked list\nIn the last node of a list, the link field often contains a null reference, a special value used to indicate the lack of further nodes. A less common convention is to make it point to the first node of the list; in that case the list is said to be 'circular' or 'circularly linked'; otherwise it is said to be 'open' or 'linear'. It is a list where the last pointer points to the first node.\n\nA circular linked list\nIn the case of a circular doubly linked list, the first node also points to the last node of the list.\nOperations Time\n\nOrder of common operations\n\nResources:\nCoursera\nIntroduction to data structures\n"}}}
